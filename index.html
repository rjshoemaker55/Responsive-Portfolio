      <p class="about-para">Hello, my name is Raymond (RJ) Shoemaker. I am 23 years old, and currently attending
        Rutgers
        Coding Bootcamp for full stack web development. On this website, you can find a few of the projects I have
        created.</p>
      <p class="about-para">I first found an interest in coding while doing Scratch projects in middle school. I always
        had fun being able to control the looks and movements of the elements, and began learning outside of school.
      </p>
      <p class="about-para">This brings me to where I am now, taking the bootcamp. I am excited to get into a career in
        programming and turn what used to be a hobby into a job! Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio,
        and feel free to contact me!</p>
